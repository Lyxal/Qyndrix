- 2d esolangs usually don't have nice support for strings and lists
- big brain idea: esolang with nice support for strings and lists

- commands can be enclosed in `{}` to make it a single transversable unit. 
- `'n` encloses the next n horizontal characters
- vertical enclosing to: `^¶¶¶v`
- directions = `VA<>`
- `[name¶...¶]` defines a block macro. `@name;` to call

```
/...
....
.../
```

 --> Inline block. Box bounded by slashes.

```
/.......
../.....
....../.
......./
``` 
--> nestable

- `~` to turn a block left into a function
- `!` to turn a block up into a function
